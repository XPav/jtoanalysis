In process software to pull the JTO lists and make pretty stats.

`combined.json` has all the lists combined.
`charts and stuff.xlsx` is an Excel file ready to PIVOT to your hearts content.

Upgrades aren't factored in yet.

I'm also not a data scientist so feel free to make fun of my wombo-combo of Python, JSON, CSV, and Excel.
